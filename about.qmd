## Profile

<p>Hi! I'm Fan Peng, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto majoring in Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about data, models, and uncovering insights behind numbers.</p>

<p>Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed strong analytical and technical skills. My goal is to combine statistical modeling with real-world applications and pursue a career in data analytics, research, or consulting.</p>

Hi! I'm Fan Peng, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto majoring in Mathematics and Statistics.

I'm passionate about data, models, and uncovering insights behind numbers.

Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed strong analytical and technical skills. My goal is to combine statistical modeling with real-world applications and pursue a career in data analytics, research, or consulting.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration or conversation!

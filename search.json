    "text": "Projects Summary\n\n\n\nByteDance Tiktok Data Analysis Project(May 2025 ‚Äì Jul 2025)\n\nBackgroud\nIn response to the explosive growth of the short-video industry, I worked as a data analyst part-time assistant at ByteDance to uncover actionable insights from massive user activity datasets on the Douyin platform. My work supported product iteration, strategic growth, and data-driven decision-making.\n\n\nKey Contributions:\n\nData Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured raw Tiktok platform data using R, Python (Pandas, NumPy), and Excel. Tasks included removing duplicates, standardizing time formats, transforming string fields, and handling outliers.\nUser Dimension Analysis: Analyzed daily views, unique users, and likes at the city level. Created visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts) using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to uncover regional user engagement trends and preferences.\nCreator Dimension Analysis: Compared content performance metrics (views, likes) across cities of both users and content creators. Identified mismatch patterns and offered suggestions for content targeting and optimization.\nBehavioral & Completion Analysis: Conducted multi-dimensional analysis on user behavior patterns, video completion rates, and content duration distribution. Used time-based and relational visualizations to generate insights for product strategy.\nStakeholder Collaboration: Worked closely with product managers, engineers, and channel teams to integrate findings into real-time testing and product iteration strategies.\nToolset: SQL, Python, Excel, R, and Rstudio.\n\n\nOutcome: Delivered weekly summary briefs and a comprehensive report integrating quantitative insights to guide content recommendation and marketing decisions.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Portfolio Website | HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n\nDesigned and developed a responsive personal website showcasing projects and skills\n\nImplemented page structure with semantic HTML and styled with modern CSS techniques\n\nIntegrated JavaScript to add interactive components such as navigation menus and dynamic content\n\nDeployed using GitHub Pages with version control via Git\n\n\n\nBrain Connectivity in Autism: A Multivariate Data Analysis Project\n\nConducted an in-depth multivariate analysis of resting-state fMRI data from the ABIDE dataset as part of an advanced statistics course, focusing on brain connectivity patterns associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nWorked with high-dimensional data comprising time-series activity across 110 brain regions for 47 subjects, including demographic information such as age, sex, and diagnosis\nPreprocessed and standardized data; extracted features through ROI pairwise correlation matrices to prepare for statistical modeling\nApplied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and identified principal components that captured intergroup differences\nPerformed Factor Analysis (FA) to uncover latent structures; discovered clusters of connectivity related to cerebellar and frontal-temporal brain regions\nConducted Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to explore associations between brain connectivity and demographic variables, revealing meaningful age and sex-related patterns\nVisualized brain activity dynamics across diagnostic groups using time series plots for selected brain regions\nDemonstrated the integration of multiple statistical techniques to extract neural signatures, interpret group-level differences, and connect connectivity patterns to behavioral traits\nAuthored final course paper titled ‚ÄúMultivariate Analysis of Brain Connectivity in Autism‚Äù\n\n\n\nClimate-Aware Cocoa Price Prediction Project\n\nConducted an end-to-end forecasting study on global cocoa prices using over 30 years of daily market and climate data (temperature, rainfall) from ICCO and NCEI Ghana\nPreprocessed high-frequency time series data by handling missing values, testing stationarity (ADF test), and applying seasonal differencing and log-transformations\nBuilt and evaluated multiple forecasting models including ARIMA, SARIMA with exogenous regressors, GARCH, and decision tree regression; trained models using rolling-origin time splits\nPerformed model diagnostics (Ljung-Box, residual ACF) and optimized hyperparameters through AIC/BIC minimization and cross-validation\nCompared models using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE; found SARIMA+xreg provided strong performance, while GARCH and tree-based methods struggled with volatility and overfitting\nVisualized actual vs.¬†predicted price trajectories to assess model responsiveness to climate shocks and market fluctuations\nProposed future enhancements using XGBoost and LSTM to model nonlinear dependencies and long-memory effects\nDemonstrated the applicability of hybrid forecasting pipelines to inform agricultural policy, supply chain planning, and market risk mitigation amid climate uncertainty\nAuthored final course paper titled ‚ÄúHybrid Time Series and Machine Learning Models for Cocoa Price Forecasting under Climate Variability‚Äù\n\n\n\nAmes Housing Price Prediction Project\n\nBuilt a multivariate linear regression model to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa, using 2,500 observations sampled from the Ames Housing Dataset\nPreprocessed data by removing missing values, detecting outliers via boxplots and Cook‚Äôs distance, and splitting into training and test sets (70/30)\nIteratively refined the model by removing insignificant predictors, checking linearity and homoscedasticity through residual plots, and applying Box-Cox transformations\nAssessed model assumptions using Q-Q plots, variance inflation factors (VIF), and partial F-tests to ensure model validity and eliminate multicollinearity\nIdentified key predictors such as basement area, year built, garage capacity, and pool quality, highlighting that total basement area added ~$68.58 in value per square foot\nRemoved high-leverage and influential points to enhance model performance, achieving an Adjusted R¬≤ of 0.85 and improved AIC/BIC scores in the final model\nProposed future improvements using non-linear models like random forests or boosting to better capture complex housing market interactions\nAuthored final paper titled ‚ÄúAmes Housing Price Estimation: A Multivariate Linear Regression Model‚Äù\n\n\n\nPortugal Family Size Determinants Project\n\nModeled determinants of family size using 1979 Portugal World Fertility Survey data with 5,000+ observations, focusing on literacy, age at marriage, and region\nApplied Poisson regression with an offset for marriage duration to account for differing fertility exposure, followed by overdispersion diagnostics and Negative Binomial modeling\nPerformed exploratory data analysis using histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to identify variable distributions and potential predictors\nIdentified that women who married at ages 15‚Äì18 had 8.6% more children on average compared to those who married at 22‚Äì25, with rural regions also showing significantly higher fertility\nInterpreted exponentiated coefficients as relative risk ratios, validated predictors using confidence intervals and likelihood ratio tests, and refined model through variable elimination\nDemonstrated that Negative Binomial regression outperformed Poisson due to minor overdispersion, providing better fit and interpretation of fertility patterns\nAuthored final paper titled ‚ÄúDeterminants of Family Size in Portugal: A Statistical Analysis Using Poisson and Negative Binomial Regression‚Äù"
